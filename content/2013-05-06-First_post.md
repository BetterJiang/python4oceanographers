summary: Python for the Oceanic Sciences and Data Analysis.

I'll <s>try</s> to write here some code snippets to help analyze, visualize and
explore data in oceans sciences.

Mostly this is a "notebook" for a future Data Analysis course.

<font color="red">This post is just a test!</font>

Testing a full notebook:

{% notebook SymPy.ipynb %}

Now just some cells (from the same notebook):

{% notebook SymPy.ipynb cells[5:6] %}

Include code examples:

{% include_code hello_world.py [Code test] %}

Seems to work fine!
