summary: Quick way to plot geographical info over an image.

Plotting a hydrographic cruise over the latest Sea Surface Temperature image
available can help a lot with the planning and/or interpretation of the cruise

So first lets define a handy function to generate the such a map:

{% notebook plotting_over_image.ipynb cells[0:1] %}

* Now just download your SST image.
* Crop the image at known lon/lat corners.
* Plot your data!

Here is the result:
{% notebook plotting_over_image.ipynb cells[1:2] %}
