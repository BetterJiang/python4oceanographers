Plotting a hydrographic cruise plan over the latest Sea Surface Temperature can
help a lot with the interpretation of the data you are visualizing.

So first lets define a handy function to generate the map:

{% notebook plotting_over_image.ipynb cells[0:1] %}

* Now just download your SST image. (If you are lucky enough to have internet
  on your research vessel.)
* and load your position data.

Here is the result:
{% notebook plotting_over_image.ipynb cells[1:2] %}
